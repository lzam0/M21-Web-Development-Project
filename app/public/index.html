            <h1>What do you know so far about sustainability?</h1>

            <p>
              "Sustainability is the goal we all share; existing together in harmony for as long as our planet would allow it.
              Sustainability is achieved and supported through three main factors: Social, Enviromental, and Economic. The
              consequences of ignoring the benefits of sustainability and allowing efforts towards it to stop, would include
              major enviromental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, loss of ecosystem services,
              land degredation, and air and water pollution. That does not include the social issues that would be caused
              such as potential losses in rights to minority groups, lapses in social justice, losing social safety nets
              set up for vulnerable groups, and also a general lose in quality of life. <br> <br>
              However, the benefits of supporting sustainability are as wonderous as these problems would be catastrophic,
              potentially increasing the world happiness index and quality of life to hitherto unknown heights, returning
              biodiversity to the point at which it might have been centuries ago, allowing natural life to flourish and
              even return to the parts of the world it has been pushed out of, and lowering costs of living and education
              to a point where anyone could afford to live and learn whatever they might want."
