                <h2>What’s the goal here?</h2>

                <p>
                    To end poverty in all its 
                    forms everywhere by 2030
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Why?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    In 2015, more than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of 
                    the world population, lived 
                    in extreme poverty, struggling to fulfil the most basic 
                    needs like health, education, 
                    and access to water and 
                    sanitation, to name a few.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the COVID-19 pandemic is reversing the trend 
                    of poverty reduction with 
                    tens of millions of people 
                    in risk of being pushed 
                    back into extreme poverty 
                    - people living on less than 
                    $1.90/day - causing the first 
                    increase in global poverty 
                    in more than 20 years.
                </p>

                <h2>So what can I do about it?</h2>

                <p>
                    Your active engagement 
                    in policymaking can make 
                    a difference in addressing 
                    poverty. It ensures that 
                    your rights are promoted 
                    and that your voice is 
                    heard, that intergenerational knowledge is 
                    shared, and that innovation and critical thinking 
                    are encouraged at all ages 
                    to support transformational change in people’s 
                    lives and communities
                </p>
